<p>Hola üëã.</p>
	<p>
		I'm <a href="/about"><b>Pedro Pi√±era</b></a>. I'm a Staff Production Engineer at <a href="https://shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a> and a
		open-source enthusiast. I fight for open, small, and human technology. I enjoy devising and
		building developer tools that spark joy. Elixir üß™, Rust ü¶Ä, Javascript üöÄ are my day-to-day
		languages.
	</p>
	<p>
		I devised and created <a href="https://tuist.io">Tuist</a> to help teams scale up Xcode
		projects, proposed a modular architecture to build apps,

	</p>
  <p>
  My <b>long-term life plans</b> are to retire my parents early and make a living by building human and open-source tools with technology. Open source has the power to impact society positively and can be financially sustainable.

## Values üå±

Here's a list of values that I believe in and that drive most of my decisions in life:

- **Genuineness:** I trust things and people when they are authentic when they don't try to make up a false appearance. I often encounter banal elements on the Internet, and I find it hard to trust them. Since I believe in being authentic, I seek authenticity myself. If I feel bad, have flaws, did something wrong, or feel excellent, that's what I share with others. I don't expect the same from others, nor I'd push them to do so.
- **Openness:** I believe in the value of being open and sharing our learnings, mistakes, work, and experiences with others. This is a value I learned from my experience doing open-source work and applies to other areas. I am open and direct when talking to people, dumping thoughts on my blog, or having discussions on GitHub. When openness is reciprocal, it inspires excellent interactions between people.
- **Humility:** I always try to keep my feet on the floor and not forget where I come from. I do so by exercising appreciation, which helps me stay humble and not let my ego devour me. I'm not a person that likes to see himself as especial, so when people see me through those lenses, I invite them not to do so by being a casual and approachable person, a friend of friends.
- **Human-first:** It's easy to lose our way in technology and forget that the ultimate goal of technology is to empower and help people. I'm a massive detractor of companies like Facebook that exploit the vulnerabilities of human beings. When I design and build software, I put people first: values, moral principles, and addiction risk. Helping them is far more important to me than building a successful product that makes people's lives worse.
- **Directness:** I like communication is clear and direct. I appreciate this from the German culture.
