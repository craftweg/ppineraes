ðŸ‘‹ Hola,

It's [Pedro PiÃ±era](https://twitter.com/pepicrft) and this is my little corner on the Internet.

I'm a software crafter.
I work as a Senior Staff Developer at [Shopify](https://shopify.com),
and in my spare time,
I build open and human tech with my lovely wife under the [Craftweg](https://craftweg.com) organization.
I love learning new programming languages and technologies and building with them.

This website is my medium to openly and candidly share what's in my mind.
Software is a recurrent theme,
but I also touch on other life experiences and learnings.
